# Project Charter for WeekendCodeSprint-AgileWebDev

## Project Purpose and Justification
The WeekendCodeSprint-AgileWebDev project aims to demonstrate the rapid development of a web application prototype utilizing Agile methodologies. This project will showcase how Agile practices can be effectively applied to software development projects with tight deadlines, ensuring flexibility, efficiency, and stakeholder satisfaction.

## Project Description
This project will deliver a functional web application prototype with a focus on user engagement and responsive design. Key features will include user authentication, an interactive user interface, and real-time data processing. The project will serve as a proof of concept for Agile methodologies in fast-paced development environments.

## Objectives and Success Criteria
- **Objective 1**: Develop a fully functional web application prototype within a weekend sprint.
- **Objective 2**: Implement Agile methodologies, including sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews, to manage the project.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Successful deployment of a web application prototype with the planned features.
  - Positive feedback from simulated stakeholder reviews on the application's functionality and design.
  - Demonstration of effective Agile practices, as evidenced by the completion of all sprint tasks within the allocated time.

## High-Level Requirements
- The web application must be accessible and responsive on both desktop and mobile platforms.
- The application must include a secure user authentication system.
- Interactive elements to engage users, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

## Assumptions and Constraints
- **Assumptions**:
  - Basic project setup and environments will be prepared ahead of the sprint weekend.
  - Team members are familiar with Agile methodologies and tools required for the project.
- **Constraints**:
  - The project must be completed within a two-day weekend sprint.
  - Limited to available open-source tools and libraries to avoid licensing issues.

## High-Level Project Timeline
- **Day 1**: Sprint Planning and Project Setup
- **Day 2-3**: Development and Implementation Phases
- **End of Day 3**: Sprint Review and Stakeholder Feedback

## Key Stakeholders
- **Project Manager (Lead)**: Anas
- **Development Team**: Volunteer contributors with expertise in web development
- **Stakeholders**: Simulated stakeholders for feedback and review

## Approval
This project charter has been prepared to guide the WeekendCodeSprint-AgileWebDev project. Approval from the project lead (Anas) is required to commence the project. Any significant changes to the project scope or objectives will be documented and require re-approval.
